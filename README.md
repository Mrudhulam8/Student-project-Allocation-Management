Introduction:
The Student Project Allocation System is a web-based application that allows students to choose their projects and supervisors. It is a system that is used by universities and colleges to allocate projects to students. The system stores the list of projects, students, and system users. The source code is easy to understand which would be a lot easier for the newbies to learn with. The system uses CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) Operations which is the common operation that is used when developing a web application that uses databases.

Proposed system:
The proposed Student Project Allocation system is based on the internet so that data can be accessed by any system and from any place. The institute will need to enter the student information into the system so that whenever they require the information they can access by simply entering the student id or name into the system. The Student Project Allocation system will contain all the information of students such as academic, address, phone number etc. It will also take the test of student and will make a list of students who all pass in the exam so that it will be easy for any institute to keep records while at the a student can check their results and class rank.
